1. The Russian IP they pull could easily be a proxy of a normal user.
2. If the IP is the real IP, reporting it can lead to international pressure and arrests.
3. They lookup the IP on one service - leak-lookup which doesn't contain all databases.
4. Hacking webservers (private) can also be done through other means such as pivoting (main site or other sites) or attacks on the server ports.
5. Godaddy was recently exposed for having been hacked for a long time with hackers maintaining full control over the distributed panel for all users.
6. They did not investigate the phishing links sent by hacker 3, given 5 or so links - checking any of them could lead to finding who they are.
7. The hackers used a post form form, reporting their usage on the service they were on can lead to taking them down and finding them
8. Hackers can easily be found through social engineering, Yes - even those on 'hacking' sites/forums they all want money and given the right circumstances WILL make mistakes.
9. They did not run a port scan on the IP address of the hacker
10. Hackers don't only attack via the methods even as mentioned before in my list - attacking other areas is just as important, but also attacking other places the email of the target might be registered with worse security. This can lead to finding known password permutations which help in cracking.
11. Phishing isn't just done via email attacks, it can also be done via doxing the target. Any real hacker would have investigated the target and realized he was fake, not just that but the domain being a honeypot.
12. They called Remote Administration Tools (RaTs) the shitty corporate term of "Remote access tools" 

For the right price, a hacker will fly out and hack the WiFi of a router and MiTM for the password. 


THEIR DOMAIN THEY USED AS THE HONEY POT WAS REGISTERED 16 DAYS AGO
They called the domain cloudlfare-ipfs.com 'fake' when it's a real domain - they arej ust hosting through it.
The same thing with the archive.org subdomain - they are using legitimate services as subdomains or hosting providers for authority.

After finding no results on the IP when searching in double quotes - they then proceeded to add multiple dorks to it to try find something on google. Dorks help narrow down results, not increase the scope. Especically the ones on https://pentest-tools.com/

They wrongly credited Loi for a Network Chuck clip in their video.

They assumed a russian with a mac PC based on the IP and header
